<b>
Create a NetworkPolicy called `np-backend` in Namespace `project-snake`. It should allow the backend-* Pods only to:

connect to db1-* Pods on port 1111
connect to db2-* Pods on port 2222
Use the app label of Pods in your policy.

After implementation, connections from backend-* Pods to vault-* Pods on port 3333 should for example no longer work.
